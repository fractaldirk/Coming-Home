    <h4>Salary tools</h4>
      <p>No graph here yet. This will be likely a bar chart of any kind. This salary function has not been build in yet. This is merely to show that this function COULD be build in. Totally optional. If the salary is specified in the job description form (just the form to get in the database, not the actual job description) then it would be possible to have an overview of current salary expenses.</p>
      <p>It would be even more useful to have a base salary and an additional salary (competency pay, so an extra 10% e.g. if level intermediate). Then it would be possible to display the total 'costs' of the competency framework.</p>
      <h4>Track competency stage</h4>
      <p>At a certain stage it would be very useful to track levels as well. For example if 60% of the Dutch offices sits in level 'intermediate' while the german office has 80% in 'expert' it would be nice to track that. That would be very very valuable data because it displays the costs, and the level of growth inside an office (meaning in the german office in this example less competency growth is possible because highest stage is almost reached). If there is no growth possible anymore likely the competency reward system could lose its key function..</p>
