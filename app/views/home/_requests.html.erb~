<p>Here all the requests are submitted. For now this will be a competency dictionary request. So when I as a user would request a competency for the dictionary, I would be able to see the status of my request here. In the livescreen the request will appear and GPI would be able to change the status (from pending into accepted or rejected) which will be visible here then. Basically this screen is an interaction between the livescreen (GPI) and operational level.</p>
